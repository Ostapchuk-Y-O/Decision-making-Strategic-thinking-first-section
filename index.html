            So, you're starting the first section of training, and you'll need to go through the following material:
        </p>
        <ul class="material-list">
            <li>one book ðŸ“™</li>
            <li>two videos ðŸŽ¥</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="details-text">
            Here's what you should focus on learning: Start by diving into the foundational book "Thinking Strategically: 
            The Competitive Edge in Business, Politics, and Everyday Life." Then, for each activity (except reading the book), 
            answer three control questions. This section is all about grasping how strategic thinking works in various situations. 
            Watch videos that explain the difference between strategic planning and strategic thinking, and explore methods for 
            developing a strategic mindset. These resources will help you understand how to anticipate future moves in both 
            business and personal decision-making.
